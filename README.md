## Description ##
This project was created for the purposes of understanding and implementing accessibility functions in webpages. It's incredibly important because people with disabilities may require content to be labelled and indexed in tandem with assistive technologies. I also learned about the process of refactoring, which is taking existing code and making changes to it for the purposes of making it better *without* changing the results of the code ("phenotype" for all of you biology majors out there). I implemented the Scout Rule, or the process of leaving the code neater/more concise than I found it - I did this by consolidating different HTML tags and CSS selectors to only include what was necessary, resulting in cleaner code. I also made sure to practice leaving comments that clearly designate different sections of the code.

## Changes to Original Code ##
* Made structural changes in terms of how the HTML/CSS elements were arranged in order to produce a more logical structure.
* Included semantic elements to replace non-semantic selements per the class instructions.
* Added comments to both the HTML and CSS files to delineate different sections and changes made.
* Consolidated different CSS selectors in order to decrease the amount of redundant code, which is ultimately easier to read and understand.
* Added alt text and title attributes for better indexing.
